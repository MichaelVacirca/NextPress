# NextPress

## Overview

**NextPress** is a modern, open-source, WordPress-like CMS framework built using **Next.js** and **Strapi**. Designed to bring flexibility, scalability, and ease of use to developers and content creators, NextPress offers a headless, component-based solution to building websites using state-of-the-art technologies.

NextPress aims to provide a modern alternative to traditional CMS platforms by combining the power of **Next.js** for the frontend with **Strapi** as the backend content management system. The result is a powerful, fast, and customizable website-building experience.

## Features

- **Headless CMS**: Manage content with Strapi, providing REST and GraphQL APIs.
- **React-based Frontend**: Built using Next.js for dynamic routing, server-side rendering (SSR), and static site generation (SSG).
- **Plugin Architecture**: Easily extend platform functionality with custom plugins.
- **Theming System**: Fully customizable themes using React components.
- **Authentication**: OAuth-based authentication integration, making user management simple and secure.
- **Scalable and Extensible**: Built to scale and integrate smoothly with modern hosting platforms and services.
